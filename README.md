# tproghip google chrome extension

*Toggle Pull Requests on GitHub Issues Pages*

I finally got tired of waiting for a filter on the GitHub Issues page to only view non-pull-request. So a few minutes on the Javascript console and then some time figuring out how to make a Chrome Extension...and now..well there's this.

This extension gives you a button that simply hides the Pull Request items on any GitHub issues page. (It will show them if you click the button again.) It's a small thing, but something I've been wanting. Enjoy.

# Install

* Pull down the repo
* In Chrome: `Chrome -> Preferences -> Extensions`
* Check the `Developer Mode` box in the top right
* Choose `Load Unpacked Extension`
* Select the top level folder of the repo

You should now see a GitHub "Pull Request" icon up near your address bar. If you find yourself on a GitHub issues page, you can now click that and it will show/hide the Pull Requests on the page.

## Disclaimers

### This is my first Google Extension

And I'm not super happy with it...I think there are "better" ways to do it...but I didn't spend too long on it. There are apparently several kinds of extensions...I just went with the first one I could get to work.

### This is not associated with GitHub

I use GitHub and I like it a lot, but this is in no way associated with or blessed by GitHub.

## Contribute

If you actually know a thing or two about Chrome Extensions, please feel free to fork and fix. If you work at GitHub and would like to add the real feature that renders this extension useless...please do.
